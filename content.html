    <p>Hi {}</p>
    <p>I’m not sure if we’ve ever had a chance to meet, but I came across your email and thought that you and some of the other people at ____________ might have an interest in a project we’re working on.</p>
    <p>I work as a professional futurist, a quirky profession for sure, but one that gives me access to an unusual set of tools for preparing for the future.</p>
    <p>In your position (of/as) ______________, I’m sure you’re questioning how future technology will affect the business decisions you’re making today. You’re not alone.</p>
    <p>That’s exactly why we created the crash course titled, “Inside the Mind of a Futurist,” oriented around techniques and strategies to predict, prepare, and profit from the future</p>
    <p>For this course I’ve teamed up with fellow future strategist, Michael Cushman, and together we will be taking participants through a series of working sessions to help make sense out of the tough times ahead.</p>
    <p>This is a 40-hour course that will take place from 9:00 am – 5:00 pm, April 10-14, 2017 – Monday-Friday at the DaVinci Institute in Westminster, Colorado. <a href="https://academy.davinciinstitute.com/futurist-course/">Details here.</a></p>
    <p>For people who register within the next week, we’re offering one hour of one-on-one consulting along with my new book, “Epiphany Z” for free.</p>
    <p>I realize this sounds ominous, but the future is judging us. Yes, the decisions we’re making today will be heavily scrutinized in the future, so it’s important we make good ones.</p>
    <p>Call me if you have any questions.</p> 
    <p>
